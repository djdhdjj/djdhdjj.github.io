I am currently a first-year master's student at Zhejiang University and a member of the **Advanced Computing and Emerging Service Lab (ACES Lab)**.  
My research focuses on intelligent service computing, recommendation algorithms, and machine learning systems.

I am particularly interested in **building next-generation recommender systems**, especially in the areas of **multi-modal learning** and **generative recommendation techniques**.

I'm always open to academic collaboration and technical discussionsâ€”feel free to reach out!
